            "content": "<p>\r\n    The Annual Obligation is a fee that member families are responsible for paying each year as a form of tuition deferment. Purchasing paper scrip and using eScrip or Schoolpop are ways to help you meet your Annual Obligation. For families with one child enrolled at Crestmont, the Annual Obligation amount is $300. For families with more than one child enrolled, the amount is $390. The portion of the Annual Obligation that is not met by scrip purchases, eScrip, and Schoolpop is added to the year?s final tuition bill. If a family earns more than their Annual Obligation, the excess amount is allocated to the general fundraising efforts of the school and benefits the school at large. Fund raising programs include the Teachers? Endowment Fund, Scholarship Fund, and other programs designated by Membership from time to time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What is Scrip?</span> Scrip is a way that schools can earn money by encouraging families to shop at participating stores in order to funnel a percentage of their purchases back to their school.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What is Scrip used for at Crestmont?</span> At Crestmont, we use scrip as a way to help members meet their Annual Obligation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How Scrip works</span> Crestmont uses three forms of scrip: Paper scrip, eScrip, and Schoolpop. The scrip committee coordinates the sale of paper scrip monthly via a paper scrip contract, which you will be receiving soon. eScrip and Schoolpop require a one-time online registration and utilize already established store loyalty programs and credit cards as a way to track dollars to be sent to the school. Advantages to the online program include: not needing to purchase paper scrip in advance, wider range of merchants from which to choose, and the ability to purchase scrip year-round (not just during the school year).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Participation from extended family and friends</span> Purchases by family and friends can be credited toward your Annual Obligation. To participate, they must register with eScrip and/or Schoolpop and designate Crestmont as the beneficiary of their scrip purchases. To receive credit for their purchases, you must supply their name(s) to the Crestmont Scrip Coordinators.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Paper Scrip</span> Paper scrip is essentially a gift certificate ? you buy scrip to use as an alternative to cash in exchange for goods at a particular business. When you buy scrip, however, businesses contribute a certain percentage of the purchase to Crestmont while you receive the whole cash value of your purchase. For example:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Crestmont buys $100 worth of scrip from The Natural Grocery Company for $94.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Crestmont sells you $100 worth of scrip for $100, thus making $6 on the transaction, thanks to The Natural Grocery Company and your purchase.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>You get scrip, which will purchase $100 of merchandise at The Natural Grocery Company.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>The $6 that Crestmont makes in this transaction is credited toward your $300 Annual Obligation ($390 for multiple children).\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    Note that in this example, The Natural Grocery Company sells scrip to Crestmont at a 6% discount. Other stores and restaurants have different discounts. The Crestmont Scrip Contract and the vendor lists at eScrip and Schoolpop will list the contribution percentage for each vendor. These percentages are the contribution amounts that will be credited toward your Annual Obligation requirement. Discounts at grocery stores tend to be in the 5% range, while restaurants and retail stores tend to be much higher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To maximize your use of scrip, be imaginative! You can use scrip to buy clothes, toys, pizza, phone cards, videos, shoes, groceries, etc. You might also consider approaching relatives and friends about purchasing scrip through you for their normal purchases. Scrip can also be given as gift certificates to friends and family for birthdays, holidays, or any special occasion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Electronic Scrip (eScrip) Program</span><br>\r\n    The eScrip program allows participating merchants to contribute a percentage of your grocery loyalty card, credit card, and debit/ATM card purchases to the school or organization of your choice (see eScrip ?merchant list? for participating merchants and cards accepted by each merchant). eScrip has a $10/year registration fee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">To enroll:</span> Register at <a href=\"http://www.escrip.com/\">www.escrip.com</a>, call (800) 592-0942, or complete the ?Card Registration Form? and mail it in.

Register your grocery loyalty cards (e.g. Safeway Club card), Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, or debit/ATM cards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Use your registered grocery/credit/debit/ATM cards at participating eScrip retailers. You can update your registered cards and other information at www.escrip.com or by calling (800) 592-0942. eScrip purchase statements will be retrieved by the Scrip Coordinators and recorded toward your Annual Obligation amount.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Schoolpop Program</span> Schoolpop offers more than 300 store, catalog, and online merchants for you to choose from. Each time you shop with participating merchants, up to 20% of your purchase is given to the school or community organization of your choice.
