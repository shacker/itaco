Note importance of the Enrolled field on the Student model. All students, parents, and families show up in the back-end Admin.
However, on the "public" site, a family must have at least one currently enrolled student in order to show up on the site.
Same goes for parents - a parent who is not associated with a family that has at least one enrolled student will be invisible.

Notes from Vickie meeting, 2/22

We'll deliver final data to the accountant - accountants don't need direct access.
But we still want to do as much tallying in the system as possible.
Accountant data listed by child's last name

Obligation hours - start with a baseline amount but allow them to be tweaked per family.

Need financial aid for families - 1 for normal, or 0.7 means 30% discount. Applies only to daycare charges.

Need "Position" picklist for the parent model

Need additional credit types see http://www.ourcrestmont.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=128

Need an accounting list summarized by credit type (not broken down by family/person)

Justine Chin (currently) Wants batch charge entry form: Assume all on same day, all of same charge type, but family different per row.

Need a school year model with billing period as fk to school years.  Reports are generated by billing period. 


Groups:
    Participation Trackers (inputting participation hours)
    Daycare Trackers (input daycare hours)
    Maintenance Trackers (maint and housekeeping hours)
    Board Credits Tracker (for board credit)
    Admin
    
    So we really just need Members, Trackers, and Admin
    
    
Recurring board credits - seldom vary month to month, so provide tool to add all credits for this month.
- Board members have roles and each role gets a different rate:

Co Enrollment 	50
Co Maintenance 	75
Co Participation 	50
Co Secretary 	50
Diversity 	100
Fundraising 	100
Health & Safety 	100
Liaison 	100
Maintenance 	150
Membership 	100
Participation 	100
Personnel 	150
President 	250
Purchasing 	100
Secretary 	100
Treasurer 	100
Treasurer 2 	100
VP 	100



Family view should show data just for current school year. Blank out when year rolls around. 
Wishlist for future: Provide access to previous year data


Not during data entry, but on family details and all reports for accountants: If a charge type is daycare and if the family it applies to gets financial aid, then apply the F.A. factor to the amount.
