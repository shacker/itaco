Thank you for applying to Crestmont school.

Once your application process is complete (application fee is received, you've attended a school tour or information event, and your child's teacher recommendation form has been received), we will contact you to schedule your child's school visit at Crestmont.

Teacher recommendation forms can be downloaded on our website at:
