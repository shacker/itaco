Dear {{app.par1_fname}}{% if app.par2_fname %} and {{app.par2_fname}}{% endif %},

Welcome to Crestmont! We have received your deposit/payment and have officially enrolled  {{app.child_first}} for the {{cur_year}} school year.

We have also created a login for each parent on the Crestmont private web site:

http://our.crestmontschool.org

We use this private site (aka iTaco) heavily throughout the year. As a co-op, it's important to be able to track credits, charges, and obligations for each parent. The site also provides contact information and rosters for all families, parents and students. Please take a moment to log in and look around. While there, please update your photo (so other parents can get to know you), contact information, and interests.  Since all school mailing lists are automatically generated from data in this site, please double check the email and contact information listed for you is current.  It is essential that you review your family's information so that all school communication, billing, and tracking can be managed effectively in iTaco.

Each parent has their own login on the site - if you have a partner, you cannot update your partner's information.  To discover your login information, click the "I forgot my password" link and enter your email. You'll receive a message that includes your username, and a link that will let you set your preferred password.

Looking forward to the new school year!

Sincerely,
