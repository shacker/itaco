Dear {{app.par1_fname}}{% if app.par2_fname %} and {{app.par2_fname}}{% endif %},

Your child, {{app.child_first}} is scheduled to attend a kindergarten evaluation at Crestmont School on [day, month, date], from [time] am. It is helpful to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early so your child will be comfortable at school before the session begins. 

The children will meet with Robin Hart-Poindexter and Dianne Driscoll in the kindergarten room. The teachers will help the children say goodbye to their parents, who will wait in the main building. Refreshments will be available and Crestmont board members will be present to answer questions about the school. During the session, the children will have free play, a short circle time, a story, a snack and an activity. 

If you have any questions, or need to reschedule the visit, please call the enrollment line at 221-6760 or email us at info@crestmontschool.org. Please let us know if your child has any food allergies. We look forward to seeing you and your child.
